# Blackjack

Welcome to my Blackjack repository! This is a classic card game that you can enjoy right in your browser. You can play it [here](https://davidhern0.github.io/Blackjack/) _(Thanks to GitHub Pages)_.

## How to Play
__Objective__: The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.

__Getting Started__: Click on "Hit" to receive another card and approach to 21. Click on "Stay" to keep your current hand.

__Scoring__: Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11.

__Winning__: If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, you win. If your hand exceeds 21, you lose.

__Blackjack__: If your first two cards are an Ace and a card with a value of 10, you have Blackjack.

## Features
